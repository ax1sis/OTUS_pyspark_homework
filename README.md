Homework for OTUS Pyspark

## Inititation string:

```
spark-submmit <script.py path> "crimes.csv path" "offense_codes path" "output file path"
```
  
 
## In my case the following code worked:

```
spark-submit ~/desktop/homework_new.py  "desktop/crime.csv" "desktop/offense_codes.csv" "path/to/output_folder/" 
```

But I was only able to run the script from ~/ directory
